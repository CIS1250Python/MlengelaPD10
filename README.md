The program - GEO POINTS GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE - demonstrates how to use a GUI with the GeoPoints Class. The program uses the [MlengelaPD9](https://github.com/CIS1250Python/MlengelaPD9/blob/main/MlengelaDP9.zip), the previous program, to make a graphical user interface
for the GeoPoint. 

1. The GUI has a text box where the user can enter the name of a file that contains a list of points and descriptions.
2. The GUI should have three more textboxes where the user can enter their own coordinates and description.
3. There should be a label for each textbox to let the user know what should be entered into those textboxes.
4. The GUI should have a button user to click. 
5. When the user clicks the button, the program should create a point representing the user's location from the coordinates and description in the textboxes,
   read the point from the file used in [MlengelaPD7](), and finally display a message in another textbox ("Label") that says something like:
             * You are closest to <description> which is located at <point's x,y, z coordinates>
